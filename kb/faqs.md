# Powerdiverter FAQs

**Q: What does Powerdiverter do?**  
A: It diverts surplus solar energy into your hot water tank, so you use more of your own solar instead of sending it to the grid.

**Q: Is it safe for me to install it myself?**  
A: No — installation must be done by a qualified electrician.

**Q: Will it work on single-phase and three-phase homes?**  
A: Yes. Powerdiverter has models for single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase systems.

**Q: Can it integrate with controlled load tariffs?**  
A: Yes. The installer can configure this during setup.

**Q: What if I run out of hot water?**  
A: You can set a boost rule in the app to top up with grid power overnight if needed.

**Q: Do I still get my feed-in tariff?**  
A: Yes — only excess energy beyond your hot water use is exported to the grid.

**Q: Can Powerdiverter work with heat pumps?**  
A: Yes, it can control both electric elements and integrate with compatible heat pumps.
